The presentation of Chris shows that it is better to save your data in a format that is reproducible that does not depend on commercialize format. The problem with commercialize product is that if the company does not operate anymore, then probably there is no way to open the file in the future. Rely on life data is alos dangerous. For example, if the government shuts down, then there's no way to access the data.

In the next project, we are introduced the website CSEP "Collaboration for the Study of the Earthquake Predicibility". We go through an example in ipython notebook to load the data from "http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/catalogs/eqs7day-M1.txt".

Notes on tools

* JSON =  Javascript Object Notation
* dexy -  a powerful documentation tool at www.dexy.it
* In ipython notebook, the number inside the brackets indicate the order of the cells.
