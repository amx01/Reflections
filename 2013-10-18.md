The presentation of Chris shows that it is better to save your data in a format that is reproducible that does not depend on commercialize format. The problem with commercialize product is that if the company does not operate anymore, then probably there is no way to open the file in the future. Rely on life data is alos dangerous. For example, if the government shuts down, then there's no way to access the data.

In the next project, we are introduced the website CSEP "Collaboration for the Study of the Earthquake Predicibility". We go through an example in ipython notebook to load the data from "http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/catalogs/eqs7day-M1.txt".

Notes on tools

* JSON =  Javascript Object Notation
* dexy -  a powerful documentation tool at www.dexy.it
* In ipython notebook, the number inside the brackets indicate the order of the cells.

Today we have invited someone from geospatial innovation facility at Berkeley to introduct their organization. Professor Stark gives a lecture today. It is "Magnitude-dependent Automatic Alarms".

<h4>
Applications of the Rabbit-Hat Theorem

* Can't turn a rate into a probability 

What would make the casino metahor apt?

- The physics of earthquakes might be stochastic.
- stochastic models might be useful for predicting future seismicity
- Unless you belive 1, rabbit theorem conclude that it cannot be random.


Seismicity models
Common stochastic models for seismicity

* Poisson. Clearly doesn't fit: too littel clustering
* Poisson for "declustered" catalogs: will pass test if you remove enough events, but standard algorithms don't
* Gamma renewal: a special poisson process in time. Every time there is an event, you stop the event over.
