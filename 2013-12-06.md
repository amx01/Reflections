I want to do a summary of this course here as we have finally come toward the end of the semester.

At the beginning of the course, we have been introduced with the concept of reproducibility and have been introduced many useful tools for computational sciences. In particularyly, I am very glad to be introduced the ipython notebook. Previously, I have some programming experience with python but do not know there exists such a great tool - the ipython notebook. Before, I just run on python IDE and edit via text editor. But with ipython notebook, everything is so organized and can be presented in such a nice way. I extremely like the feature for how the ipython notebook can be converted to a html file instantly. It is super reproducible, efficient and presentable. I am very thankful honestly to have learned this tool in this course. Aside from that, the other wonderful tool that I have been introduced with is Markdown. Suprisingly, I have never known that github text editing is incorporated with markdown! Markdown is very good for presentation. It is so cool and simple to use for presentation. Again, it's super efficient and can be nicely organized. It can also be made into beautiful slides as well so we don't even need to do the annoying adjustments for the integrations with text and graphics in powerpoint! 

Due to the curiosity to discover more functionalities of the tool, I basically did everything from the beginning to the end product for the first project. I really like that project overall as I am able to apply the skills I have learned and make a reproducible product. The project in fact marks the first half of the semester and we have switched gears to the earthquake prediction project, which is the final goal and outcome of the class.

To me, the Earthquake prediction model is very new to me because I did not have any prior experience with geosciences. But I think this project is very interesting. I have been reading research papers regarding the ETAS model that is widely used currently in order to gain a better understanding of the field. I have tried to run the existing pacakges for the ETAS models and have produced some interesting graphs. Prof. Stark has introduced us with the MDAS model that is main part of Luen's dissertation thesis is about. I make a better understanding of the improvements made in that model comapred to the ETAS model. I have also reproduced some graphs of the ETAS model and MDAS model on my own with Luen's implementation. Although our class is not able to create a model that makes significant improvements over the previous ones, I am glad that I have been exposed to the field of geosciences and how closely it is related to statistics and the importance of doing statistical predictions and making models. I hope that if I have chance in the future, I can do some of the related work for that field. 

Coming to this weekend, we are going to wrap up the course and present what we have learned in the data science faire. I take the responsiblity for reproducibility for the poster presentation. By this weekend, I am going to make a summary of reproducibility base on the scientific research community point of view and base on my experience in this class. Other than that, I will collect survey results from the class and make a nice illustration for the thoughts for how students think about the concept. I will also consult instructors from the course to finalize the materials to be presented and ask for improvements. 

Overall, this class is a very new experience to me. There are so much more collaborations than traditional courses and I think it should be more focused in other classes as well. For improvements, I suggest that there should be a better structure for each week's goal so that the final outcome of the course will not be delayed. But it is quite difficult since students have different level and experiences in programming which this classes requires, it takes a large amount of time for students who have no programming exeriences to cooperate. If this class is being offered again, I suggest at least student has taken STAT133 or have computer programming experience can be enrolled. Not only that this can help the class to collaborate more effectively, students can gain more and work on the ultimate goal in a more efficient way. I hope my comments would help in the construction of future similar classes and thanks for all the staff teaching the class!
