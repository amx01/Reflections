Today's main focus is on presentation for the questionnaire project. Most of the groups  choose the presentation format as ipython notebook, including my group. The reason is that ipython notebook provides a very nice and clear environment to show both the code and the graphics in a html format. ipython notebook is highly reprodicible, you can just download the notebook if you want to try out and I am really glad to have learned this useful tool in this class.

For our group project, we highly focus on reproducbility. Instead of having many files, we make it so much simpler to integrate everything into one ipython notebook file. The purpose of this project is for visualization. We have two approach to this problem: use th matplotlib package and also by R. It is really fun to do that in the process to explore different tools and try new things. In most of the time I use R/Matlab to generate graphs but I never try to do that within python. I also discover that I can actually use R within python, which is really interesting to do that. 

Some of the road blocks we encounter in the project is that not everyone is familiar with python. So basically I do the main part in writing code in python and my other teammate who is familiar with R generate most of the graphics. I think the most exciting part is to combine everything together into one format. I really enjoy the process of doing and learning new tools in this project.

During the presentation time, it is really interesting to see what others group have done comparing to ours. We notice that most groups have similar results and the graphs are somewhat similar. I think the main reason is that we just need  to choose two columns to compare and find out the relationship. And maybe the data is limited, it is a bit hard to find the correlation. But I think it is fine because what we have learned is try to explore different tools in python for data analytics. After we have learned how to use these tools, we can perform more complex tasks in the future. 

Overall, this project is a very good start to explore the python data analytics tools and I am looking forward to doing more projects in the coming up class.
